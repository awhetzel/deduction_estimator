## Overview

This is my first adventure with Django. It is a web app developed to
allow employers to calculate and monitor data related to employee
benefit packages.

## Building and Running the Application
TODO

## Features and usage
TODO

## Testing
So far, I have tested this application by letting my family tinker
with it. I was interested in the testing tutorials, but this was a
time sensitive learning exercise so I didn't do any TDD or automated
testing.

### Known Bugs
There are currently no known bugs in the project.
